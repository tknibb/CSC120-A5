- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
    - At first I was nervous I wouldn't understand association but relating it to trains and doing the code made me understand it a bit more.
    
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    - What didnt work is overthinking and being scared on the task before even attempting it. What worked is calmly reading all the instructions and not freaking out and over-complicating things. Doing it step-by-step helped me not stress too much about it all. Also collaborating with other people helps me a lot because multiple brains is better than one. My advice I would give someone taking this course in the future is to not stress too much, work with others, and take it one step at a time.
